# Andrew-Seatter-Project-Portfolio

## Description
The goal of this project was to utilize our newfound flexbox and media query knowledge to build a project portfolio. I definetly was a little humbled and plan to revisit this as I work through some more course material and get a better feel for css. All of the images in the project section were placeholders until I can eventually have some more projects to fill that space.
## Usage
Portfolio acts as a a catalogue for future projects. All images act as links and they respond to different sizes of screens. Links in the nav bar will take you down to various parts of the page and all of the contact links on the bottom are functional as well.
